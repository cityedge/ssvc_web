  `source/BUILD.md` for rebuilding/replacing the encoder. The combined Browser Media I/O release ZIP instead
  provides `src/`, build scripts and the lockfile at its root; see `docs/BUILDING.md`.
  Preserve these materials when redistributing it.

These dependencies retain their own licenses. Redistributing an application with them requires preserving
their notices and meeting the applicable source availability requirements. The repository's MIT license
does not replace their licenses.

Playwright, Vite, TypeScript and the locally installed FFmpeg/ffprobe are development and test tools;
they are not required by the browser-side core at runtime.
